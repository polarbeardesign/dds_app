<h1>Devil Dog Squadron</h1>

<p>The Devil Dog Squadron is a volunteer organization of the <a href="http://www.commemorativeairforce.org/">CAF</a>, dedicated to flying, maintaining and preserving a WWII B-25 bomber, the Devil Dog. The Devil Dog represents a PBJ, the Marine Corps version of a B-25.</p>

<p>The squadron's volunteers come from all walks of life and have wide variety of backgrounds. It takes many different skills to make the group successful.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping to preserve the Devil Dog the are many opportunities to do so. The monthly staff meetings are open to the public and are a good chance to meet the members and learn more about the group (and there is often a BBQ lunch!). </p>

<p>The monthly meetings are usually followed by work on the aircraft or preparation for the next airshow, providing a great opportunity to get up close and personal without the usual crowds that surround the Dog at airshows. Check our <a href="../calendar">calendar page</a> for meeting dates and times.</p>

<h2>Membership</h2>

<p>We are always looking for new members. There is a lot of work to do, but we have fun doing it. And it's not all work in the hangar. Members have the opportunity travel with the Dog to airshows. </p>

<p>If you would like to join the squadron, membership is open to all CAF members. You can fill out our online membership application.</p>
