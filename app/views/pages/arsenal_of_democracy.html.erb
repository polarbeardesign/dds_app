<p>There is an historic aviation event taking place in Washington, D.C., May 7-9, 2015, the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE Day). The Arsenal of Democracy World War II Victory Capitol Flyover is hosting a tribute to the men and women at home and abroad that made victory possible, including the contributions of our manufacturing sector that helped win the war.</p>

<p>The Flyover will include 15 historically sequenced warbird formations that travel across our nation’s capital – from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol. The Flyover will feature over 70 warbirds representing the major battles of World War II, from Pearl Harbor to D-Day with a final Missing Man Formation to “Taps.” Never before has such a collection of WWII aircraft been assembled at one location, to honor the large group of veterans that will be gathered at the WWII Memorial.</p>
