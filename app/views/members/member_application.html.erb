<h1>Devil Dog Squadron<BR />Membership Application</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest in joining the Devil Dog Squadron. We are always looking for new members. There is a lot of work to do, but we have fun doing it. And it's not all work in the hangar. Members have the opportunity travel with the Dog to airshows.</p>

<p>Squadron membership is open to all Commemorative Air Force (CAF) members. If you are not yet a member of the CAF, you can learn more about the benefits of membership, and download an application form, at the <a href="http://commemorativeairforce.org/membership/membership-options">CAF's membership web page</a>.</p>

<p>Please complete and submit the following form. Regular squadron dues are $75 per year, or $25 for Cadets under 18. After you submit the form there will be a link to pay online.</p>
